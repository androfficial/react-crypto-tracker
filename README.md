Design decisions were made after looking at other cryptocurrency tracking sites.

> How to use your project (if it's not self-explanatory)

For the project to work correctly on the localhost, you need:

- Register and get a free API key for the correct operation of websockets [Get API Key](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/).
- Create a `.env` file in the root of the app and place a variable with your API key in it

```bash
VITE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
```
